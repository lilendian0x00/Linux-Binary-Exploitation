# Function prologue and epilogue

^PROLOGUE^
-------------
```
push  ebp         ; Save the stack-frame base pointer (of the calling function).
mov   ebp, esp    ; Set the stack-frame base pointer to be the current location on the stack.

sub   esp, N      ; Grow the stack by N bytes to reserve space for local variables
```

^EPILOGUE^
------------
```
mov   esp, ebp    ; Put the stack pointer back where it was when this function was called.
pop   ebp         ; Restore the calling function's stack frame.

ret               ; Return to the calling function.
```
