The processor includes some internal memory storage locations, called registers.

**The registers store data elements for processing without having to access the memory**

Categories of Registers
------------------
```
|General Registers|
|Control Registers|
|Segment Registers|
```
General Registers
------------------
```
(Data Registers):
	^EAX: Accumulator register (AX). Used in arithmetic operations.
	^ECX: Counter register (CX). Used in shift/rotate instructions and loops.
	^EDX: Data register (DX). Used in arithmetic operations and I/O operations.
	^EBX: Base register (BX). Used as a pointer to data (located in segment register DS, when in segmented mode).

(Pointer Registers):
	#EIP: stores the offset address of the next instruction to be executed.
	#ESP: Stack Pointer register (SP). Pointer to the top of the stack.
	#EBP: Stack Base Pointer register (BP). Used to point to the base of the stack.

(Index Registers):
	$ESI: Source Index register (SI). Used as a pointer to a source in stream operations.
	$EDI: Destination Index register (DI). Used as a pointer to a destination in stream operations.

Most Important Control Registers (EFLAGS)
---------------------------------
```
@Overflow Flag (OF) − It indicates the overflow of a high-order bit (leftmost bit) of data after a signed arithmetic operation.

@Sign Flag (SF) − It shows the sign of the result of an arithmetic operation. This flag is set according to the sign of a data item following the arithmetic operation. The sign is indicated by the high-order of leftmost bit. A positive result clears the value of SF to 0 and negative result sets it to 1.
(sign flag, set when the result of an operation is negative)

@Zero Flag (ZF) − It indicates the result of an arithmetic or comparison operation. A nonzero result clears the zero flag to 0, and a zero result sets it to 1.
(zero flag, set when result of an operation equals zero)

@Carry Flag (CF) − It contains the carry of 0 or 1 from a high-order bit (leftmost) after an arithmetic operation. It also stores the contents of last bit of a shift or rotate operation.
(carry flag, set when the result of an operation is too large/small)
```


Segment Registers
-------------------
```
CS) Pointer to Code Segment
DS) Pointer to Data Segment
SS) Pointer to Stack Segment
ES, FS, GS) Extra Segment Registers available for storing data
```
