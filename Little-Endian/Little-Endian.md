# Little-endian 

Little-endian is an order in which the "little end" (least significant value in the sequence) is stored first

**Most processors are little endian and most network protocols are big endian**

**The least significant byte (LSB) of an integer is stored at the lowest address of the integer. The most significant byte (MSB) is stored at the Highest Address for data items in x86 Processors.**

Python Command to convert Hex Address to Little Endian Format (return as a byte string)
------------------------------------------
```
>>> import struct
```

```
>>> struct.pack("<I", 0xbffff750)
b'P\xf7\xff\xbf'
```


```
>>> struct.pack("I", 0xbffff750)
b'P\xf7\xff\xbf'
```

**Both of them do the same work...**
